# Tichy_TownHall_Website
Yokoso! 
I'm going to explain you how my website works 

First, for the back-end part you will find it in the System folder, it is imperative to import the database that you will find in the datalayer folder under the name registration(1).sql 

the applicationlayer folder is the folder that contains the session login system
and the applicationlayer folder is the folder that contains the sessions of each user 

note that you will find a server file in the datalayer that will allow me to manage the appointments and the errors that will probably be made by the user in question.

for the website, it's the front-end, you'll find everything static you can modify as you want with html, php code.

There's the search bar and lots of sections you can modify if you want to change images etc.....

you also have an image folder where you can find all the pictures and images I used in this site 

That's all, enjoy ^^
